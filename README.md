## Techstacks used:

Python, Machine Learning Algorithms(linear regression,knn,Decision Tree), Restaurant Revenue dataset

## How to Run Locally:

*Clone the project

*Take some feedback from the customers as we already provided via drive link in above download from that

*Train and test the model with data

## What Next?

This project will be helpful to detect the customer feedback. In future we are going to anlayze the restaurant revenue based on cutomer review,ratings and feedback.If the customer reviews was better then sales are good
